## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Cannot Access Jenkins UI
- Ensure the VM is running
- Check if the URL is correct
- Verify that port 8080 is open in the firewall rules

#### Login Problems
- Verify you're using the correct credentials
- If you've lost the admin password, you can reset it via SSH:
  ```bash
  sudo cat /opt/bitnami/jenkins/credentials/initialAdminPassword
  ```

#### Service Not Starting
If Jenkins service doesn't start, try:
```bash
sudo /opt/bitnami/ctlscript.sh restart jenkins
```

## Maintenance

### Starting/Stopping Jenkins

To manage Jenkins service:

```bash
# Start all services
sudo /opt/bitnami/ctlscript.sh start

# Stop all services
sudo /opt/bitnami/ctlscript.sh stop

# Restart all services
sudo /opt/bitnami/ctlscript.sh restart

# Check status
sudo /opt/bitnami/ctlscript.sh status
```

### Updating Jenkins

Bitnami packages are configured to be updated with minimal effort:

1. Connect to your VM via SSH
2. Update the Bitnami stack:
   ```bash
   sudo /opt/bitnami/ctlscript.sh stop
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get upgrade bitnami-jenkins
   sudo /opt/bitnami/ctlscript.sh start
   ```

## Uninstallation

To remove the Jenkins deployment:

1. Go to "Deployment Manager"
2. Select your Jenkins deployment
3. Click "Delete"
4. Confirm the deletion

This will delete all resources associated with the deployment, including the VM instance and persistent disks.
